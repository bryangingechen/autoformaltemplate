# Dispatch log — exceptions only

Coordinator-owned record for `/coordinate-phase` sessions. **Routine
clean dispatches are NOT logged** — git history is the record. Log a
row only for an **exception**:

- an **escalation** (BLOCKED return or failed verification →
  re-dispatched one rung up) — log both halves' cost;
- a deliberate **probe** below the mapped rung, and its outcome;
- a **BLOCKED / killed / salvaged** dispatch (what stranded, what was
  recovered, resume-vs-relaunch);
- a **gate-invisible defect caught in verification** (shape
  deviation, additive-repin miss, deletion-hygiene miss, faithfulness
  defect, unsatisfiable deferred hypothesis) — the catch *and* which
  check caught it;
- a **playbook deviation** (rung substitution beyond the session
  config, an off-map rung choice) and its outcome.

Provenance: this replaces the per-dispatch model-tier experiment log
(concluded 2026-07 across CombinatorialRigidity + enharmonic, ~890
rows; findings promoted into the coordinator command's *Dispatch
playbook*). The experiment's own history showed per-dispatch logging
re-bloats — rows recapping math the commit message already carries —
so the schema below keeps only what git cannot show.

## Row discipline

- **Notes ≤ ~600 chars** — the exception's cause and lesson, never a
  recap of the mathematics (the commit message is the recap). If a
  sentence restates what the *commit* did rather than how the
  *dispatch* went wrong, cut it.
- **Append by matching the previous row's tail only** — an edit span
  that includes the following section header silently deletes that
  header (this clobbered a log's Findings heading three times in one
  ancestor session).
- Write the row only after the verification pass completes in full;
  correct a committed row by a follow-up edit, not a
  history-rewriting amend.

## Log

| Date | Task (short + sha) | Rung | Exception | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Findings

(Distill recurring lessons here — one entry per lesson, rows cite it.
At phase close, promote stable entries into the coordinator command's
*Dispatch playbook* / CLAUDE.md and prune.)
